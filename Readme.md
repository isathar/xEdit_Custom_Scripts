WIP xEdit scripts for skyrim/Skyrim SE.

I will be updating and adding more scripts and better instructions over time. 
- For now, this is mostly wip stuff while learning the process by trying to create something like Automatic Perks/Spells/Potion Distribution.


SkyrimSE - NPC Perks Patcher.pas
- Adds perks to all NPCs in loaded plugins based on their skill levels and character classes. Filter configuration files are included in NPCPerks/config.
  
  Usage:
  Load any plugins you want to process NPCs from (including official files), run the script (Apply Script).
